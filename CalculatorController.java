Name & NET-ID:      Harsh Gopalan - HXG190023
Class & Section:    CS 2336. 005
Assignment:         Assignment 6 - Simple Calculator using JavaFX
Start / End Date:   11/17/2021 - 12/03/2021
Purpose:            Writing this program for this class to complete Assignment 6.

General Description of Program:

    This program uses Java FX to create a simple calculator. The calculator will perform
    basic operation such as, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division using buttons.
    The calculator will make sure that the user is notified of a divide by zero error, and
    will not allow non-numeric values to be entered to the calculator, and will not allow a
    crash due to this either. The program also has a clear button that will clear the input fields
    and reset the result label to 0.
    Overall, the program makes use of two text fields for the input values, five buttons for the four
    operations and the clear option, and a result label that will display the result.
